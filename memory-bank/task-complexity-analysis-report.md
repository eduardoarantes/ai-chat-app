   - **Risk Level**: High

2. **TASK-004 (LangChain Integration)**: Framework version compatibility
   - **Mitigation**: Pin specific LangChain versions and test thoroughly
   - **Risk Level**: Medium-High

3. **TASK-010 (Testing Suite)**: Comprehensive coverage across all components
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental testing approach, start early in development cycle
   - **Risk Level**: Medium

### Critical Dependencies

- TASK-007 (Vector Embeddings) is foundation for TASK-008 and TASK-009
- TASK-004 (LangChain) is prerequisite for entire Phase 2 pipeline
- TASK-010 (Testing) depends on all other tasks being stable

## Timeline and Resource Implications

### Before Breakdown
- **Total Estimated Hours**: 226 hours
- **Average Task Complexity**: 6.9/10
- **High-Risk Tasks**: 6 out of 10

### After Recommended Breakdown
- **Total Subtasks Created**: 48 subtasks from 6 high-complexity tasks
- **Average Subtask Complexity**: ~5.2/10 (estimated)
- **Reduced Risk Profile**: Most subtasks fall within manageable complexity range

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003**: Build foundation before complex integrations
2. **Prioritize TASK-004 breakdown**: Critical for Phase 2 pipeline
3. **Implement TASK-007 incrementally**: Highest complexity requires careful approach
4. **Begin TASK-010 early**: Testing should start as soon as stable components exist

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that 60% of tasks require breakdown due to high complexity. The recommended subtask decomposition reduces average complexity from 6.9 to approximately 5.2, making tasks more manageable and reducing project risk.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Break down TASK-007 (highest priority due to 9/10 complexity)
2. Break down TASK-004 (blocks Phase 2 development)
3. Create detailed implementation plans for remaining high-complexity tasks
4. Establish testing framework early (TASK-010A)

This systematic approach will ensure successful delivery of the enhanced file upload and processing capabilities while maintaining code quality and project timeline adherence.
